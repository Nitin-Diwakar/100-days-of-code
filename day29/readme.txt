if you take the first 1000 characters that are most commonly used,

then you can pretty much read most of the Newspapers,

you can watch most of the TV shows because these

are the words that are the bread and butter of the language. It's like in English,

the a, the, of, from, why, yes, no,

these are words that we use every day, again and again.

The crazy words like anti-establishment or glioblastoma.

These are not words that you need to really know for day to day life.

So let me show you the program that you'll build

where you can learn the most frequently used words in any language.

It's a flashcard program,

and it shows you the front and the back of the card. So for example,

French, demande. In English means request. After three seconds,

the card flips and I can check whether if I knew the right answer.

If I got it right I'll press the tick and if I got it wrong

I'll press the cross. So let's try another word.

Parti means left or to leave. Attendez

means to wait

and I think I knew that word. So I'm going to click the check mark.

And what that's going to do is it's going to take the flashcard out of all of

the list of flashcards so it doesn't show me the things I already know.

And instead it only shows me the things I don't know

so I can review it and say, Oh, I'm not sure what loin means

so I'll say cross,

and that will go back into the deck and it might come up again at some point.

So this beautiful piece of software is what we're going to be creating.
