## Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the selection sort algorithm. 
### Note : The selection sort improves on the bubble sort by making only one exchange for every pass through the list. 
### Sample Data: [14,46,43,27,57,41,45,21,70]
### Expected Result: [14, 21, 27, 41, 43, 45, 46, 57, 70]
