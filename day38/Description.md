## Write a Python program for sequential search.
## Sequential Search: In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a particular value in a list that checks each element in sequence until the desired element is found or the list is exhausted. The list need not be ordered.
### Sample Data :
### Sequential_Search([11,23,58,31,56,77,43,12,65,19],31) -> (True, 3)
