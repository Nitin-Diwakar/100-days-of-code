## Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the merge sort algorithm.
### Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows :
### * Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
### * Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
