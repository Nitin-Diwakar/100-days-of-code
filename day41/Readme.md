## Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the insertion sort algorithm
### Note : According to Wikipedia "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort."
### Sample Data: [14,46,43,27,57,41,45,21,70]
### Expected Result : [14, 21, 27, 41, 43, 45, 46, 57, 70]
